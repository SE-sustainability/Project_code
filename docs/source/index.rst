Reminders App - 2C
===================================
We have created this Reminders app to make sure that you can have peace of mind when leaving the house and doing day-to-day activities. Allowing them to remind themselves to do regular activities that they may have anxiety about such as remembering to lock the door as well as turning all the lights off. The user may look at the app as a reminder to themselves that they have done the action and when the reminder is no longer needed it can be deleted from the app.

The app will have 5 pages, which will allow the user to Add, see, edit and delete reminders, this is where the code documentation will help show the code and what it does.
